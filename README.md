# J-Steg

Small group Android Project completed for Senior Capstone.

Team ABCD Members: Joe Amadeo (@AppDude27), Mariah Burks(@MahrieRae), Javier Contreras(@Dizzylul), Daniel Doan(@Rexura)

Our project will use steganography to encrypt text into an image. We intend to use Java and make this project into a mobile application for Android devices.

When the application is opened, a main menu will be displayed, and the user will choose to either encrypt or decrypt an image. When encryption is selected, an image chosen from a picture gallery. When the image is selected, a new page will be displayed with the image and the user can input text and an optional pin number. The text is then encrypted into the photo upon pressing the encrypt button and the encrypted image is saved in a seperate folder. When the action is complete, the user returns to the main menu.

If decryption is selected, the user will be asked to provide an image to be decrypted. The screen will display the selected image and give the user the option to give a pin. When Decrypt is pressed the program will attempt to decode the image. If no message is present, a message is printed. If there is a message to be decrypted, then it will be displayed. When the action is completed, the user will be returned to main menu.
